# .env file
```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@127.0.0.1:5432/public"
POSTGRES_USERNAME="user"
POSTGRES_PASSWORD="password"
POSTGRES_DB="public"
POSTGRES_PORT="5432"
AUTH_SECRET="xxxxxx" # Generated symetric jwk from jose that is base 64 encoded after stringification
CSRF_SECRET="xxxxxx" # Generated Bytes that are base 64 encoded. 
```

# How To Use
I do go over this in the web demo video but here is a text version as well.

1. Clone the repository and open your favorite terminal
2. Create a .env file like the template above
3. `docker compose up -d` To start the postgres database (you may need to install docker).
4. `npm i`
5. `npx prisma migrate dev`
6. `npx prisma generate`
7. `npm start`

## About the Application
This app is mostly for fun but it does feature the ability to get loans which increase the cents in given
accounts. I mainly had a lot of creative fun with the backend. I created my own CSRF protection and 
my own rate limiting using the postgres datasource and prisma. This code represents a minimalist
implementation of a **secure** express web app with no static files.

# How To Test
`npm i -D && npm test`
